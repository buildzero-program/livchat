# Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to [livchat.ai/dashboard](https://livchat.ai/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy your key immediately (it won't be shown again)

<Warning>
  Store your API key securely. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.livchat.ai/v1/session/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer lc_live_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## API Key Types

| Prefix | Environment | Usage |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `lc_live_` | Production | Live WhatsApp messages |
| `lc_test_` | Test | Testing and development |

## Scopes

API keys have scopes that limit what they can access:

| Scope | Access |
|-------|--------|
| `whatsapp:*` | Full access to all WhatsApp endpoints |
| `whatsapp:messages` | Send and manage messages |
| `whatsapp:contacts` | Access contact information |
| `whatsapp:session` | Manage WhatsApp session |
| `whatsapp:groups` | Manage groups |
| `whatsapp:webhook` | Configure webhooks |

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 401,
    "message": "Invalid API key"
  }
}
```

**Causes:**
- Missing `Authorization` header
- Invalid or expired API key
- Malformed key format

### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 403,
    "message": "API key does not have required scope: whatsapp:messages"
  }
}
```

**Causes:**
- API key doesn't have permission for the requested endpoint
- Request a new key with the required scopes

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store API keys in environment variables, not in code:
    ```bash
    export LIVCHAT_API_KEY="lc_live_..."
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys periodically">
    Create new API keys and revoke old ones regularly for security.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use minimal scopes">
    Only request the scopes your application needs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor usage">
    Check the dashboard for API key usage and suspicious activity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage:

| Plan | Requests/minute | Requests/day |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| Free | 60 | 1,000 |
| Pro | 300 | 10,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

When rate limited, you'll receive:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 429,
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
    "retryAfter": 60
  }
}
```
